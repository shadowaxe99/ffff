The architecture of the system is as follows:

- Component A: Handles data processing. It receives input data, performs various computations and transformations, and produces the desired output.
  - Subcomponent A1: Responsible for data ingestion and preprocessing.
  - Subcomponent A2: Performs complex calculations and data analysis.
  - Subcomponent A3: Generates reports and visualizations based on processed data.

- Component B: Manages user interface. It handles user interactions, displays information, and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
  - Subcomponent B1: Handles user authentication and access control.
  - Subcomponent B2: Displays data and allows users to interact with it.
  - Subcomponent B3: Provides a dashboard for monitoring system status and performance.

- Component C: Handles database operations. It is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, ensuring data integrity, and performing database-related tasks.
  - Subcomponent C1: Manages database connections and transactions.
  - Subcomponent C2: Implements data models and schema.
  - Subcomponent C3: Optimizes database performance and handles backups and recovery.
